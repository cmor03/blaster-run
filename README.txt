Blaster's Great Escape / Blaster Run

Game Overview:
Blaster Run is an exciting arcade-style shooter where players navigate through waves of enemies while collecting power-ups and trying to achieve the highest score possible.

Technical Implementation Details:

1. Core Technologies:
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+) with class-based architecture
- CSS3 with modern features (gradients, transitions, flexbox)

2. Game Architecture:
- Modular class-based design for easy maintenance and extensibility
- Efficient game loop using requestAnimationFrame
- State management system for different game states (menu, playing, game over)
- Collision detection system for projectiles and enemies
- Particle system for visual effects

3. Key Features to Implement:
- Smooth player movement using mouse control
- Dynamic enemy spawning and movement patterns
- Power-up system with various effects
- Score tracking and high score system
- Visual effects for explosions and collisions
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes

4. Challenging Aspects:
- Implementing smooth collision detection
- Creating engaging enemy movement patterns
- Balancing game difficulty
- Optimizing performance for particle effects
- Creating responsive controls that feel natural

5. File Structure:
- index.html: Main game page with canvas and UI elements
- blasterrun.css: Modern styling with responsive design
- blasterrun.js: Game logic and class implementations
- images/: Directory containing game sprites and assets

6. Implementation Notes:
The game uses a class-based architecture with the following main components:
- Game: Main game controller
- Player: Player ship controls and rendering
- Enemy: Enemy behavior and rendering
- Projectile: Projectile movement and collision
- PowerUp: Power-up effects and collection
- ParticleSystem: Visual effects for explosions

The code is structured with clear TODOs and comments for easy implementation of remaining features.

This project demonstrates proficiency in:
- Modern JavaScript programming practices
- Game development concepts
- HTML5 Canvas manipulation
- CSS3 styling and animations
- Responsive web design
- Object-oriented programming
- Game physics and collision detection
