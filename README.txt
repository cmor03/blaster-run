- CSS3 with modern features (gradients, transitions, flexbox)

2. Game Architecture:
- Tile-based maze system with collision detection
- Enemy AI with simple movement patterns
- Timer-based gameplay mechanics
- Carrot collection and gate unlocking system
- Responsive controls using keyboard input

3. Key Features:
- Interactive maze with walls, traps, and collectibles
- Dynamic enemy movement
- Time-based challenge system
- Gate unlocking mechanics
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Intuitive keyboard controls (WASD/Arrow keys)

4. Challenging Aspects:
- Implementing smooth collision detection for maze walls and objects
- Creating engaging enemy movement patterns
- Balancing game difficulty with time limits and carrot placement
- Optimizing performance for smooth gameplay
- Creating responsive controls that feel natural
