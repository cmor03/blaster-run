Blaster's Great Escape - A Maze Adventure Game

Game Overview:
Help Blaster the donkey escape from a challenging maze! As a clever donkey with access to TNT, Blaster must strategically place explosives to defeat giant monsters while collecting carrots to unlock the final gate. This engaging game combines maze navigation, strategic trap placement, and timing-based gameplay.

Technical Implementation Details:

1. Core Technologies:
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+) with class-based architecture
- CSS3 with modern features (gradients, transitions, flexbox)
- Particle system for explosive effects

2. Game Architecture:
- Tile-based maze system with collision detection
- Enemy AI with pathfinding
- TNT placement and explosion system
- Timer-based gameplay mechanics
- Carrot collection and gate unlocking system
- Responsive controls using keyboard input
- Particle effects system for explosions

3. Key Features:
- Interactive maze with walls, traps, and collectibles
- Strategic TNT placement mechanics
- Giant enemies that chase the player
- Particle-based explosion effects
- Time-based challenge system
- Gate unlocking mechanics
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Intuitive keyboard controls (WASD/Arrow keys + Space)

4. Challenging Aspects:
- Implementing smooth collision detection for maze walls and objects
- Creating engaging enemy pathfinding
- Balancing game difficulty with time limits and enemy size
- Implementing particle system for explosions
- Creating responsive controls that feel natural
- Strategic TNT placement timing
